          Hello! My name is Jack Keller, and I’m a Master’s student at Georgia Tech studying computer science and specializing in Modeling & Simulation. I graduate this December, and I’m currently pursuing full-time software engineering roles beginning as early as January 2026.
          <br><br>
          The purpose of this site is to showcase a bit of my experience, what I’m passionate about, and some of the projects I’m most proud of. If you’d like to get in touch, please see below and reach out!

    <h2>Experience and Interests</h2>
    <div class="experience-content">
      <p></p>
      My experience includes several software engineering internships at <strong>J.J. Keller &amp; Associates, Inc.</strong> and <strong>Honeywell</strong>, as well as research with the <strong>Robotic Musicianship Lab</strong> and <strong>Puerto Rico Planning Studio</strong> (focused on post-disaster recovery) at Georgia Tech.
      </p>
      <p>
      I believe what truly sets me apart is my ability to break down complex concepts into clear, comprehensible terms to help others learn and succeed — a skill I’ve honed over five semesters as a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> for Computer Organization &amp; Programming (CS 2110) and Algorithms (CS 3510/11) at GT. I'm very excited to lead Algorithms as <strong>Head TA</strong> in Fall 2025!
      </p>
      <p>
      My primary interests lie in <strong>modeling and simulation</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>. I'm especially passionate about applying these technologies to infrastructure and systems, urban planning, and sustainability to improve people’s lives and society as a whole.
