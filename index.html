          Hello! My name is Jack Keller, and I’m a Master’s student at Georgia Tech studying computer science and specializing in Modeling & Simulation. I graduate this December, and I’m currently pursuing full-time software engineering roles beginning as early as January 2026.
          <br><br>
          As a technical yet people-oriented person, I find deep fulfillment in helping others learn and succeed. My education, alongside several software engineering internships at J.J. Keller &amp; Associates, Inc. and Honeywell, have provided me with a strong computer science foundation—particularly in modeling, simulation, and AI. However, I believe what really sets me apart is my ability to break down complex concepts into clear and comprehensible terms, helping others understand and grow too. Whether TAing Algorithms and Computer Organization and Programming at Georgia Tech for over 2 years, or conducting post-disaster research in Puerto Rico to help communities recover faster, I’ve learned that my passion truly lies in utilizing technology to improve people's lives and society as a whole.
          <br><br>
          The purpose of this site is to showcase a bit of my experience, what I’m passionate about, and some of the projects I’m most proud of. If you’d like to get in touch, please see my contact info below and reach out!
